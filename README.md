## Development

### Building Skill Packages

Skills are built and packaged as part of the [fulfil.io website](https://github.com/fulfilio/website) deployment process.

**How it works**:
1. This repository is included as a git submodule in the website repository
2. The website's build script (`scripts/build_claude_skills.py`) scans for skill directories
3. Each skill is packaged into a ZIP file and copied to `static/downloads/claude-skills/`
4. Skills are served directly from the website at `/static/downloads/claude-skills/`

The website build process automatically creates ZIP packages from all skill directories matching the `##-skill-name` pattern.

### Skill Structure

Each skill folder follows this structure:

```
##-skill-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md           # Comprehensive guide for Claude
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # User-facing documentation
â””â”€â”€ QUICK_REFERENCE.md # Quick reference card
```

The skill package (ZIP file) includes all files in the skill directory.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions! To add a new skill:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new skill folder: `##-skill-name/`
3. Include all three markdown files (SKILL.md, README.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
4. Submit a pull request

Your skill will be automatically packaged and deployed as part of the fulfil.io website build process once merged.
