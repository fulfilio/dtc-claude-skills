## Development

### Building Skill Packages

Skill packages are automatically built and deployed via GitHub Actions on every push to the `master` branch.

**How it works**:
1. You push changes to `master` branch
2. GitHub Action runs `build.py` (Python + Jinja2)
3. Generated files are committed to `gh-pages` branch
4. GitHub Pages deploys from `gh-pages` branch

This keeps `master` clean with only source files, while `gh-pages` contains the built artifacts.

To build manually (for testing):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python build.py
```

This will:
- Parse frontmatter from each skill's README.md
- Create ZIP files for each skill in `docs/downloads/`
- Generate the download index page at `docs/index.html` using Jinja2 templates
- Display build summary

The build process runs automatically when:
- Any skill folder (`##-skill-name/`) is modified
- Build script or templates are updated
- The workflow file is changed

### Skill Structure

Each skill folder follows this structure:

```
##-skill-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md           # Comprehensive guide for Claude
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # User-facing documentation with frontmatter
â””â”€â”€ QUICK_REFERENCE.md # Quick reference card
```

**README.md Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
title: Skill Title
description: Short description shown on download page
author: Your Name
version: 1.0
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
learn_more_url: https://fulfil-website.com/resources/claude-skills/your-skill
---
```

**Frontmatter Fields**:
- `title` (required): Display name of the skill
- `description` (required): Brief description shown on download page
- `version` (required): Version number (e.g., 1.0, 1.1)
- `author`: Author or organization name
- `tags`: List of categorization tags
- `learn_more_url`: URL to detailed documentation (opens in new tab)
