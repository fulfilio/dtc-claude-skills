## Development

### Building Skill Packages

Skills are automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

**How it works**:
1. When changes are pushed to the `master` branch, GitHub Actions workflow triggers
2. The workflow scans for skill directories matching the `##-skill-name` pattern
3. Each skill is packaged into a ZIP file in the `downloads/` directory
4. The downloads directory is deployed to GitHub Pages
5. Skills are available at `https://fulfilio.github.io/dtc-claude-skills/downloads/`

The build process automatically creates ZIP packages from all skill directories that contain a `SKILL.md` file.

### Skill Structure

Each skill folder follows this structure:

```
##-skill-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md           # Comprehensive guide for Claude
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # User-facing documentation
â””â”€â”€ QUICK_REFERENCE.md # Quick reference card
```

The skill package (ZIP file) includes all files in the skill directory.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions! To add a new skill:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new skill folder: `##-skill-name/`
3. Include all three markdown files (SKILL.md, README.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
4. Submit a pull request

Your skill will be automatically packaged and deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions once merged.
