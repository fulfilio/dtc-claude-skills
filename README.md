## Development

### Building Skill Packages

Skill packages are automatically built and deployed via GitHub Actions on every push to the `master` branch.

To build manually:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will:
- Create ZIP files for each skill in `docs/downloads/`
- Generate the download index page at `docs/index.html`
- Display build summary and next steps

The build process runs automatically when:
- Any skill folder (`##-skill-name/`) is modified
- The build script is updated
- The workflow file is changed

### Skill Structure

Each skill folder follows this structure:

```
##-skill-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md           # Comprehensive guide for Claude
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # User-facing documentation
â””â”€â”€ QUICK_REFERENCE.md # Quick reference card
```

### Contributing

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new skill folder: `##-skill-name/`
